1. Can we store a duplicate key in HashMap? How does HashMap handle collisions in Java?
No we should not store a duplicate key in a HashMap but the hash function might turn two different keys into the same hash value
resulting in a collision. Java handles collision by storing values a nodes to liked lists withing the hash array allowing collisions
to live at the same index. the collisions can then be sorted out using a liner search

2. Give some name of sorting algorithms. Among them which one you think is fastest?
Bogo-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort


3. How merge sort works? What is the time complexity for merge sort?
merge sort separates n values into n/2 pairs and sorts thous pairs. Then it combines and sorts thous groups until it reaches
the original list of items except sorted. It can be implemented recursively in java. The time complexity of the algorithm is
O(nlog(n)) due to the processing of each layer of merges occurring in

4. How can we traverse all the nodes of graph?


5. Write the applications of Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS
